# Ponnect - Helping Students Connect

Ponnect is a mobile application designed to bring students together by helping them discover activities and connect with others who share their interests.

## About the Project

This is a **cross-platform mobile application** built using the [Expo](https://expo.dev) React Native framework, with a **Firestore database** for data storage.

### Features

- **Interactive Map-Based Navigation**  
  The app is centered around a **map of the university town** (currently supporting Cluj-Napoca), displaying various **locations** and the activities available.

- **Location Filtering & Details**  
  Users can filter locations by category and view **detailed location pages** with pictures, descriptions, and other relevant information.  

- **Group Events**  
  Unlike other platforms, Ponnect allows users to **create group events** at specific locations on a chosen date. These events serve as **open invitations** for other users to join.

- **User Profiles**  
  Each user has a profile that can be edited to enhance credibility and trust within the community.
